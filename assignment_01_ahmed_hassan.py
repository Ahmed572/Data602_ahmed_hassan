# This program gets three test scores and displays their average.  It congratulates the user if the 
# average is a high score. The high score variable holds the value that is considered a high score.

HIGH_SCORE = 95

# Get the test scores.
#needed to convert the inputs from the user to type int as it is currently taking str
test1 = int(input('Enter the score for test 1: '))
test2 = int(input('Enter the score for test 2: '))
#adding test3 as it is not declared. We will need it to calculate the average
test3 = int(input('Enter the score for test 3: '))
# Calculate the average test score.
#I added the parenthesis to fix the order of operations logic. The way it was before, test3 was divided by 3
#added to test1 and test2. Now we are adding test1,2, and 3 then dividing by 3. This is logically correct to find the average
average = (test1 + test2 + test3) / 3
# Print the average.
#just adding space and a colon here in the print statement to make it look cleaner
print('The average score is: ', average)
# If the average is a high score,
# congratulate the user.
#the variables declared are case sensitive. We need to make sure that the variable is the same as the variable declared
if average >= HIGH_SCORE:
